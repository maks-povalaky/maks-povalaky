## Bio

I'm a software developer with experience in building applications using modern web technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Postgres. My current work involves developing internal tools for a construction company, including a time-tracking system with role-based access control. I have a strong background in building dynamic and interactive UIs, utilizing libraries like Framer Motion, Radix UI, and TanStack Query. I also focus on server-side operations, leveraging the app router in Next.js for efficient data handling and state management.
